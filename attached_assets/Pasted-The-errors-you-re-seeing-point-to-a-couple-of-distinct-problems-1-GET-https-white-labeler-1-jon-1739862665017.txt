The errors you're seeing point to a couple of distinct problems:

1. GET https://white-labeler-1-jononovo.replit.app/api/user 401 (Unauthorized) :

This error means your frontend (likely index-BbX6PYhO.js ) is successfully authenticating with Google, but your backend API ( /api/user ) is rejecting the request because it doesn't recognize the user as authorized. This is a backend issue, not a Firebase Authentication issue. Here's what to check:

Authentication Header: After a successful Google login with Firebase, your frontend should send an ID token to your backend API. This ID token proves the user's identity. Make sure your frontend code is correctly adding the ID token (obtained via firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken() ) to the Authorization header of your API request (e.g., as a Bearer token: Authorization: Bearer <your_id_token> ).

Backend Verification: Your backend ( /api/user ) needs to verify this ID token. You should not be doing this verification in your frontend. The verification must happen on your backend server for security reasons. This usually involves:

Making a request to the Firebase Admin SDK to verify the token's validity and retrieve the user's information.

If the token is valid, you can allow access to the /api/user endpoint.

If the token is invalid or missing, return a 401 (Unauthorized) error.

Replit Deployment: If your backend runs on Replit, make sure you have configured your server correctly to receive and process requests with the Authorization header containing the Firebase ID token. Replit's environment has its own setup requirements.

2. index-BbX6PYhO.js:1038 Firebase not initialized: missing configuration :

This error indicates that your frontend JavaScript code is trying to use Firebase but hasn't been properly initialized with your Firebase configuration. This is a frontend issue.

Firebase Initialization: Ensure you've correctly initialized Firebase in your frontend JavaScript code before you attempt any Firebase authentication actions. You need to provide your Firebase project's configuration details (obtained from the Firebase console) in a firebaseConfig object and pass it to firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig); . Double-check the values you're using for apiKey , authDomain , projectId , etc. Make absolutely sure that this initialization occurs before any other Firebase calls.

Import Statements: Confirm that you've correctly imported the necessary Firebase modules (especially firebase/app and firebase/auth ). Modern Firebase uses modular imports. Do not use the old style script includes. Using a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel is highly recommended for managing these imports in a production environment.
