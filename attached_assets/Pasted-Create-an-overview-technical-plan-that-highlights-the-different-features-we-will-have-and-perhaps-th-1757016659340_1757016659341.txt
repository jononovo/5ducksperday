Create an overview technical plan that highlights the different features we will have and perhaps the different files and what each file will do for example, 
A. Do we need to determine what operating system we are on with a specific file to determine that and then serve a pre-notification asking for permission to be granted to the website to load the app? Or ?
B. if permission is granted to open another app should we open outlook.com or gmail.com and open the compose window instead? Or should that be the default?
C. Do you think we should ask the user to tell us if he wants us to open a compose window in Gmail or if you would prefer we use the default application should we like have a modal/ pop-up the first time for the user to choose what the default sending setting should be ( new tab - gmail compose, outlook.com - new tab,  open default email app, Any other? )
and save that to the user database? 

Any other thoughts?

5Ducks Email System - Technical Implementation Plan
Document 
Executive Summary
I've created a comprehensive technical plan that addresses all your questions with a smart, user-centric approach:

A. Operating System Detection Strategy
✅ Proactive Detection + Contextual Notifications

Detect OS/browser once on app load, cache results
Show pre-notifications only when relevant (e.g., iOS permission warning only when user chooses "Default Email App")
Separate detection service from notification service for clean architecture
B. Permission Granted - Default Behavior
✅ Intelligent Platform-Aware Defaults

Mobile (iOS/Android): Default to native email app (mailto) - users expect this
Desktop: Default to Gmail web compose - more reliable since many don't have email clients configured
Always honor explicit user preferences when set
C. User Preference Modal Strategy
✅ Smart First-Time Setup with "Set and Forget" Philosophy

Recommended Options:

🎯 Smart Default (Recommended) - Platform-aware automatic selection
📬 Always Gmail - Consistent web experience
📮 Always Outlook - Alternative web option
📧 Always Default App - Native app preference
❓ Ask Every Time - Maximum control
Show Modal When:

First email send ever
User clicks "Change Email Settings"
Primary method fails repeatedly
User explicitly requests it
Don't Show When:

User has preferences set
Quick/urgent workflows
Recently dismissed
Key Architecture Highlights
🧠 Intelligence Layer
Environment Detection Service - Knows platform capabilities
Smart Default Selection - Adapts to user's platform
Success Rate Tracking - Learns from failures and adapts
🎯 User Experience Layer
Educational Modals - One-time setup guidance
Pre-Notifications - Platform-specific warnings
Universal Fallback - Gmail/Outlook/Copy options when mailto fails
🔧 Technical Layer
Character Limit Management - Platform-specific optimization
URL Builder Service - Handles encoding complexities
Analytics Service - Tracks success rates and user patterns
Additional Thoughts & Recommendations
🚀 Progressive Enhancement Approach
Start with basic mailto + Gmail fallback, then add intelligence:

Phase 1: Core functionality (2 weeks)
Phase 2: User experience polish (2 weeks)
Phase 3: Intelligence and analytics (2 weeks)
Phase 4: Advanced features and A/B testing (2 weeks)
📊 Success Metrics to Track
Email send success rate by platform
User preference distribution
Fallback usage patterns
Time from button click to successful send
🎨 UX Considerations
"Smart Default" as recommended option reduces decision fatigue
Platform-specific explanations in preference modal
Easy preference changes without re-showing educational content
Graceful degradation when things fail
The file structure provides clean separation of concerns while the preference system gives users control without overwhelming them. The intelligence layer means it gets better over time based on actual usage patterns.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific component or dive deeper into the implementation details for any particular file?
