Full-Scale Audit: Streak Page & Daily Outreach Email System
1. General Overview of Features and Functions
What's Built:
Streak Dashboard - A gamified sales dashboard with:
Current streak tracking (consecutive days of outreach)
Statistics (today, week, month, all-time emails sent)
Outreach schedule configuration (days per week, time, vacation mode)
Product selector for active campaign
Preview button for email template
Daily Batch Generation System - Automated system that:
Selects 5 uncontacted leads daily from user's database
Prioritizes by confidence score and role availability
Generates personalized emails using Perplexity AI
Creates secure tokens for batch access
Email Review & Send Page (/outreach/daily/{token}) - Allows users to:
Review 5 generated emails
Edit subject lines and body content
Mark emails as sent or skip them
Copy email content to clipboard
Notification System - Sends daily "nudge" emails via SendGrid to remind users
2. Cron Job Analysis
✅ What Works:
Scheduler exists with proper cron expression generation
Initializes on server start (outreachScheduler.initialize())
Supports flexible scheduling - users can set days and times
Handles timezones correctly
⚠️ Critical Issues:
No actual email sending mechanism - The system only sends notification emails, not the actual outreach emails
"Mark as sent" is manual - Users must copy/paste emails into their own email client
Cron relies on server uptime - If the server restarts, cron jobs are lost until next initialization
No persistence of cron state - Server crashes lose all scheduled tasks
3. Production Readiness Assessment
✅ Production-Ready Components:
Database schema properly structured with PostgreSQL
Authentication and security (Firebase + session management)
Secure token-based batch access (24-hour expiration)
AI email generation using Perplexity API
SendGrid integration for notifications
❌ Major Functional Gaps:
No Actual Email Sending
The system CANNOT send outreach emails directly
Users must manually copy/paste into their email client
"Mark as sent" just updates database status, doesn't send anything
No Gmail/Email Integration
Despite having Gmail integration code elsewhere, it's not connected to daily outreach
No OAuth flow for email sending permissions
No tracking of actual email delivery/opens/replies
Scheduler Reliability Issues
Cron jobs are in-memory only (lost on server restart)
No job queue or persistent scheduling (should use something like BullMQ)
No retry mechanism for failed batch generation
No monitoring or alerting for scheduler failures
Limited Contact Selection
Only pulls from existing contacts in database
No automatic refreshing of contact pool
Will fail silently when user runs out of contacts
Missing Features for Production:
No email templates management
No campaign tracking/analytics
No unsubscribe handling
No bounce management
No rate limiting for API calls
No backup scheduler mechanism
4. Is This Demo or Production?
This is a PROTOTYPE system, not production-ready:
What's Real:
Database storage and relationships
AI-powered email generation
User authentication
Basic UI/UX flow
What's Missing for Production:
Actual email sending capability
Reliable background job processing
Email delivery infrastructure
Campaign analytics
Error recovery mechanisms
Scalability considerations
5. Recommendations for Production:
Implement actual email sending via Gmail API or SendGrid bulk sending
Replace in-memory cron with persistent job queue (BullMQ, Agenda.js)
Add email tracking - opens, clicks, replies
Implement proper error handling and retry logic
Add monitoring and alerting for scheduler failures
Create email template system for better personalization
Build analytics dashboard for campaign performance
Add compliance features - unsubscribe links, GDPR compliance
Summary:
The Streak page and daily outreach system is a well-architected prototype that demonstrates the concept effectively but lacks critical production features. The biggest gap is that it doesn't actually send emails - users must manually copy/paste generated content. For production use, this system needs significant enhancements to email infrastructure, scheduler reliability, and campaign management features.
