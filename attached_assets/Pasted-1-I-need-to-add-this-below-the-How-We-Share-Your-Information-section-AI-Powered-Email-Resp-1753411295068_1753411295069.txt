1. I need to add this below the “ How We Share Your Information
“ section.  —  AI-Powered Email Response Suggestions 
We do not use data accessed through Google Workspace APIs or Photos APIs for any AI analysis. No AI/ML model interacts directly with data obtained from these APIs. If and when we introduce our optional “Replies” feature, email responses displayed within the app (sent via the user’s Gmail integration) may be made available to the user—but AI analysis of that content will only occur if and when the user explicitly requests it. This optional analysis is performed entirely within our app’s environment and only targets the specific replies the user has chosen to process. No other inbox content is included, and until the user manually enables this feature, no AI-powered processing of email data takes place. We remain committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in strict accordance with applicable laws and Google’s API Services User Data Policy.   Google API Services Compliance

5Ducks's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. We use Google API data solely for providing and improving the features you've requested, and we do not use Google API data for serving advertisements or for any purposes unrelated to the core functionality of our email campaign service.

Data Separation and Protection
We maintain strict separation between data accessed through Google APIs and any AI processing systems. Google API data is used exclusively for:
* Sending emails on your behalf through Gmail
* Retrieving basic profile information for authentication
* Providing core email campaign functionality
AI features, when enabled by users, operate only on data stored within our platform and never directly access or process data from Google APIs.

 ——  2. Also remove this section from the document:  International Transfers: When we transfer your personal data outside the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as:
* Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.
* Binding Corporate Rules for transfers within our corporate group.
* Adequacy decisions by the European Commission, where applicable.
 Data Retention: We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
