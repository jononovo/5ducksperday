Create a tool that 

1.takes a prompt.

I am offering a coding platform white label solution. 
With this company can offer our existing or new coding lessons to the clientele under their own brand.

I need the top 10 potential business fuck off customers in Chile who may want to buy to augment their educational business:

Target, medium sized private Coding, Stem, Steam, and other K-12 educational companies in the US .

2. searches 8 different approaches around the company to
A. Enrich the company snapshot (short list of data points)
B. Find the Leadership team members.
C. Find the email of leadership team members.
D. Alternatively, either a general contact email, or an email of a related person in the company.


Each of the 8 diffeernt search approaches should be an editable prompt via the workflow interface.

3. Compile the results into a snapshot/list of the company with these data points:

- Age of company
- Size of company
- relative success
- ranking of website
- prominence of LI profiles of leadership
- number of customers or probably success of company
- online ratings and reviews
- services offered
- summary of key points that validate it as target.
- Final Total Customer Probability Score 

4. Filter the top 50 results in order of probability of success using a ranking system.
 - Put a weight to each element within the business snapshop . Resulting in a final score for each business.
 
5. Add the top 1- 3 contacts within each target business.
 - Populate an email or suggested contact method for the suggested priority decision-maker.
 -  If an email is available for a certain person, but not another, prioritize the one with the email available.
 
Make sure all this is entered into a simple, and easy to use table ( or DB, but the DB must be easily viewable on a webpage per Target company or even as a whole.) Perhaps even google sheet could be used for this, but it may be easier to host a simple table elsewhere.

Use n8n for the workflow management.
