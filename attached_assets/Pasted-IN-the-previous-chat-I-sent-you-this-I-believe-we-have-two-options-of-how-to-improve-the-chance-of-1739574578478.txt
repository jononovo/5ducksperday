IN the previous chat I sent you this:

I believe we have two options of how to improve the chance of getting correct contact names in our search:

API Call to Filter: Serve the contact list to an affordable ai to sort out and remove designations, titles, partner organizations and headers that are all not names, but often listed as such.
1A. This could be a cheap, secondary API call that would provide a probability score on the name of the contact.
1B. Contacts with low probability score would be pushed down until rarely visible.

Build internal ML database based on manual feedback from contact lists.
2A. For example, we could add on tap of the contact name, a mini-menu to rate the name as:

Excellent: Correct for company
OK: At least a real-looking name
Terrible: Not a name at all.
Over time, our list of positives and negatives should build a better probability analysis and remove them.

But I'm not sure if this would be helpful, or would actually help the AI search tool be more effective.

What do you think?

So you then made this implementation plan:

Thank you for these thoughtful suggestions about improving contact name validation. Let me analyze both options:

Option 1 (AI Filter API):
Pros:

Immediate implementation possible
Consistent results
Can leverage existing AI models
No training period needed
Cons:

Additional API costs
Latency from extra API calls
Dependency on external service
Option 2 (Internal ML Database):
Pros:

Improves over time with user feedback
No additional API costs
Domain-specific learning
User engagement through feedback
Cons:

Takes time to build sufficient training data
Initial accuracy might be lower
Requires storage and management of feedback data
I recommend implementing Option 1 first, then gradually transitioning to Option 2. Here's why:

We can use the AI filter API's results as initial training data for our ML system
The feedback UI from Option 2 can still be implemented alongside Option 1
Over time, as we collect enough user feedback, we can reduce dependency on the external API
Would you like me to proceed with implementing either or both of these approaches?
