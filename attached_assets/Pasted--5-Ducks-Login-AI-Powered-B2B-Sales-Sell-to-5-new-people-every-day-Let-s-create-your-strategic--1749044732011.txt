My Story
I do 10 push-ups before every shower and I realized that if I do 20, I will very soon stop doing them. But I will explain that later.

In February, after spending an embarrassingly long amount of time creating a SaaS product with a couple of developers. It was finally time to start selling. But being easily distracted, I instead figured that I should create a tool that will make selling easier for me. (Of course!!! That's not procrastination. That's efficiency.)

I then got distracted in workflows to optimize the sales and lead generation. However, finally coming back to this, I decided to launch it because, who the hell wants to open their inbox (with all those clickbait newsletters and juicy news updates) and THEN start sending sales emails?!? That's like asking an alcoholic to work at a bar. It's so distracting.

The other thing I realized is that all the other lead generation services that popped-up when I was searching, were for people with big budgets and usually needed someone to set it up for them.

I wanted something for the small guy that he could get running in less than 60 seconds. And that could be addictive and fun.

Now back to those pushups. Well, I realized that the harder the task is, the more likely that I will abandon it, and not make it habit. And I figured, if I can make the selling process much, much easier, but then put a limit so that people will not feel guilty leaving after five minutes, that they might enjoy it more AND may make a habit out of it.

Umm,... yeah.
Thanks for listening and enjoy.

Perfect! So you're selling orange juicers, customers say fast cleaning, and I can learn more at https://zummocorp.com/us/commercial-juicer-machines/orange.

Now let's build your 90-day cold email strategy!

What type of business do you sell to? I need to create daily search queries for finding contacts. The more specific, the better!

Examples: "family-friendly hotels in coastal Florida" or "mid-size logistics companies in tri-state area"
