Let me look at the extension service and the frontend search to understand the full implementation:
Could you figure out why there was an error in my deployment?

The development environment looks fine. Let me check the LSP error and look for deployment-related issues:
can't you check the logs from deployment?
Don't you have access to that?

Unfortunately, I don't have direct access to production deployment logs. I can only see the development environment logs. To view your deployment error: 1. Go to the **Publishing** tab in Replit 2. Look at the **Logs** section there 3. You can filter by errors and search for specific text If you copy and paste the deployment error here, I can help analyze it and figure out what's wrong. That said, the TypeScript error I found in `extension-service.ts` is a real issue that would cause a build failure during deployment - so it's very likely the culprit.
can you check the logs here?
