Let me look at the extension service and the frontend search to understand the full implementation:
Could you figure out why there was an error in my deployment?

The development environment looks fine. Let me check the LSP error and look for deployment-related issues:
can't you check the logs from deployment?
Don't you have access to that?

Unfortunately, I don't have direct access to production deployment logs. I can only see the development environment logs.

To view your deployment error:

Go to the Publishing tab in Replit
Look at the Logs section there
You can filter by errors and search for specific text
If you copy and paste the deployment error here, I can help analyze it and figure out what's wrong.

That said, the TypeScript error I found in extension-service.ts is a real issue that would cause a build failure during deployment - so it's very likely the culprit.
