Detailed Technical Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Remove Frontend Dependencies (Lines to modify)
Step 1: Clean up prompt-editor.tsx
Line 12: Remove import { useSearchStrategy } from "@/lib/search-strategy-context";
Line 13: Remove import SearchSettingsDrawer from "./search-settings-drawer";
Line 538: Remove const { selectedStrategyId } = useSearchStrategy();
Lines 556, 569, 724: Replace selectedStrategyId ? parseInt(selectedStrategyId) : undefined with undefined
Lines 1019-1022: Remove the SearchSettingsDrawer component render block
Step 2: Clean up App.tsx
Line 9: Remove import { SearchStrategyProvider } from "@/lib/search-strategy-context";
Line 236: Remove opening <SearchStrategyProvider> tag
Line 244: Remove closing </SearchStrategyProvider> tag
Step 3: Clean up home.tsx
Lines 609-611: Remove the unused searchApproaches query:
const { data: searchApproaches = [] } = useQuery<any[]>({
  queryKey: ["/api/search-approaches"],
});
Phase 2: Remove Backend Dependencies
Step 4: Clean up server/routes.ts
Lines 541-553: Remove the entire /api/search-approaches endpoint
Step 5: Clean up shared/schema.ts
Line 267: Remove export type SearchApproach = { id: number; name: string; description?: string };
Phase 3: Delete Orphaned Files
Step 6: Remove component files
Delete client/src/components/search-settings-drawer.tsx (81 lines)
Delete client/src/components/search-strategies.tsx (196 lines)
Delete client/src/lib/search-strategy-context.tsx (30 lines)
Phase 4: Validation
Step 7: Verify no broken imports
Check for any TypeScript/LSP errors after removal
Ensure application compiles without errors
Step 8: Test functionality
Verify search still works without strategyId
Confirm no console errors in browser
Test that the search button area no longer shows the settings icon
Impact Summary
Total lines removed: ~400+ lines
Files deleted: 3
Files modified: 5

Risk Assessment
✅ Low Risk - All changes are removing unused code:

Backend ignores strategyId already
UI shows empty drawer with "future update" message
No functional dependencies on these components
Search will continue working exactly as before
Rollback Plan
If any issues occur:

The changes are isolated and can be reverted file by file
No database migrations or data changes are involved
Git history will preserve all removed code if needed later
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan?
