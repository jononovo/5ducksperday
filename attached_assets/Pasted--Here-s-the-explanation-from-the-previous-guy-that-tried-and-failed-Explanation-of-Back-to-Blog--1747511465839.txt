Explanation of "Back to Blog" Button Fix Attempts
Initial Approach
I examined how the "Back to Blog" button was implemented in the blog-post.tsx file.
The original implementation used a Link component from wouter wrapping a Button component:
<Link href="/blog">
  <Button variant="ghost" className="mb-8 flex items-center">
    <ArrowLeft size={16} className="mr-2" />
    Back to Blog
  </Button>
</Link>
First Fix Attempt
I removed the Link component and tried using the navigate function from useLocation hook:

// Changed imports
import { useRoute, useLocation } from "wouter";  // Removed Link import
// In the component
<Button 
  variant="ghost" 
  className="mb-8 flex items-center" 
  onClick={() => navigate("/blog")}
>
  <ArrowLeft size={16} className="mr-2" />
  Back to Blog
</Button>
This approach didn't work, but I noticed something important - the "Back to Blog" button in the error state (line 18 in blog-post.tsx) was using the exact same navigate pattern and it worked.

Research Findings
I examined other pages in the application to understand the navigation patterns:
In list-details.tsx, back navigation used onClick={() => navigate("/lists")} with a Button component
In blog.tsx, navigation to individual posts used Link components wrapping Buttons
I also verified that App.tsx had the correct routing setup:
<Route path="/blog" component={() => <Blog />} />
<Route path="/blog/:slug" component={() => <BlogPost />} />
Final Fix Attempt
Reverted to using the Link component, but implemented it correctly:
import { useRoute, useLocation, Link } from "wouter";  // Re-added Link import
<Link href="/blog">
  <Button 
    variant="ghost" 
    className="mb-8 flex items-center" 
  >
    <ArrowLeft size={16} className="mr-2" />
    Back to Blog
  </Button>
</Link>
Possible Issues Preventing the Fix from Working
Event Bubbling: There might be parent elements capturing click events
Component Rendering: The way the component renders might be affecting the Link behavior
React Lifecycle: There could be issues with how the component is mounting/unmounting
Route Configuration: While the routes appear correct in App.tsx, there might be a subtlety with how they're handled
Wouter Implementation: There could be an issue with how wouter's Link component is implemented in this specific context
To successfully fix the issue, I recommend looking at the most similar working navigation example in the codebase (like the blog card navigation to posts) and copying that exact pattern, including any parent wrappers or context providers that might be affecting the navigation behavior.
