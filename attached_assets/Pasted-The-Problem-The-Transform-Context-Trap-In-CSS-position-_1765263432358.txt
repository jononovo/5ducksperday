The Problem: The "Transform Context" Trap
In CSS, position: fixed normally positions an element relative to the browser window (viewport). However, if any parent element has a CSS transform, filter, or perspective property (which framer-motion adds for animations), that parent becomes the new "anchor" for the fixed element.

Why it's happening in your new app:

Your new application likely wraps the page content in a <div> that has a layout or animation (e.g., a Page Transition wrapper or a main content area next to a sidebar).
This wrapper creates a "Transform Context."
The "Secret Code" input, which is set to fixed top-1/2 left-1/2, is now centering itself inside that wrapper, not the screen.
If your new app has a sidebar on the left, the "center" of the wrapper is to the right of the actual screen center. That's why your input is shifted right.
The Solution: Use a React Portal
To fix the "Enter Code" field centering, we need to "teleport" it out of that container and attach it directly to the <body> tag. This ensures it is truly centered on the screen, ignoring all parent layouts.

Here is the fix for Home.tsx (or Landing.tsx):

Update Imports:
Add createPortal to the React import.

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { createPortal } from "react-dom"; // <--- Add this

Modify the Input Rendering:
Find the section rendering the <Input> inside Left Content. We need to conditionally render it into a Portal when it's in the "fixed" mode (currentIndex === 5).

This requires a slight refactor to separate the Input component so it can be moved, but a quicker fix is to use the Portal just for the overlay state.

Simpler Workaround (CSS Only):
If you don't want to refactor for Portals yet, you can try forcing the element to break out using viewport units, though fixed is still tricky.

Recommended Fix (Code Snippet for your developer):
Tell them to wrap the "Secret Code" input section in a Portal when currentIndex === 5.

Regarding the "Cut Off" Images
The duck/images sliding to the right (x: 400) are intended to exit the screen.

In the standalone app: The main container has overflow-x-hidden, so when the image slides right, it cleanly disappears.
In the new app: If the parent container does not have overflow: hidden, or if the body handles overflow differently, you might see the image sticking out, causing a horizontal scrollbar or looking "cut off."
Fix: Ensure the root <div> of the migrated component retains overflow-x-hidden.

// Make sure the outer-most div has this class
<div className="min-h-screen w-full bg-background overflow-x-hidden relative flex flex-col">

If the new app puts this inside a padded container (like p-8), w-full + `p

-8=100% + padding, which causes overflow. **Fix:** Changew-fulltow-autoor ensure the parent hasno padding`.
