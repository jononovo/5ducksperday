Complete Analysis - You Were Right!
After thorough investigation, I found FOUR interconnected issues that all need to be fixed:

1. Campaign Recipients Not Populated ❌
When a campaign is created, it saves contact_list_id but never copies contacts into campaign_recipients table
Result: totalRecipients = 0 because getCampaignWithMetrics counts from empty table
2. Contact List Name Not Fetched ❌
getCampaignWithMetrics returns the campaign with contactListId but NOT the contact list name
It never joins with contact_lists table to get the list details
Even if we populate recipients, the UI won't have the list name to display
3. UI Doesn't Display Contact List ❌
CampaignDetail.tsx has no field in Campaign Settings for showing which contact list is used
The contactListId exists in the data but is completely ignored by the UI
No visual indication of which contact list the campaign is targeting
4. TypeScript Errors in Storage ⚠️
Lines 708-709 in storage.ts reference campaign.totalRecipients and campaign.emailsSent
But these fields don't exist in the Campaign schema - they're calculated metrics
This causes TypeScript errors and potential runtime issues
The Complete Solution Required
To properly fix this, we need to:

Fix campaign creation (server/features/campaigns/campaigns/routes.ts):

After creating campaign, query all contacts from the contact list
Batch insert them into campaign_recipients with status='pending'
Enhance data fetching (server/storage.ts):

Join with contact_lists table in getCampaignWithMetrics
Return contactListName in the response
Fix TypeScript errors (use fallback values instead of non-existent fields)
Update UI (client/src/pages/CampaignDetail.tsx):

Add a "Contact List" field to Campaign Settings section
Display the contact list name received from backend
Fix TypeScript issues:

Remove references to non-existent campaign.totalRecipients and campaign.emailsSent
Use calculated values or 0 as fallbacks
Without ALL these fixes, the problem won't be fully resolved.
