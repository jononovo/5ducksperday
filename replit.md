## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Mobile UI preference: Compact, space-efficient design with seamless header-to-content transitions.

## System Architecture
The application features a **React SPA frontend** built with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS (using shadcn/ui), TanStack Query, React Router, and Radix UI. The **backend** is developed with Express.js and TypeScript.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Modular API Design:** Distinct route handlers and business logic ensure maintainability. Feature-based folder structure with self-contained modules (e.g., server/features/gmail-integration, server/features/health-monitoring, server/features/lists, server/features/email-templates, server/search, server/user-account-settings, server/email-replies, server/campaigns) following the email-content-generation pattern. Major search modularization completed (Sep 2025) reducing routes.ts from 3521 to 2843 lines (19% reduction, 678 lines extracted). Additional modularization (Sep 2025) extracted user-account-settings (~200 lines), email-replies (~140 lines), and campaigns (~100 lines) modules, further reducing routes.ts to ~2400 lines (32% total reduction from original).
- **Search Module Architecture:** Comprehensive search functionality extracted into dedicated module (Sep 2025) with organized submodules: server/search/sessions (session management), server/search/companies (company search), server/search/contacts (contact discovery), server/search/providers (email providers: Hunter, Apollo, AeroLeads), server/search/orchestrator (multi-stage email enrichment). This improves maintainability, testability, and code organization.
- **Hybrid Storage Architecture:** PostgreSQL is used for structured data (users, lists, companies, contacts, email_templates, strategic_profiles), while Replit Key-Value Database handles volatile data (credits, Gmail tokens, subscriptions, notifications).
- **Multi-stage Search Process:** Orchestrates company discovery, contact extraction, and email enrichment using AI and external APIs.
- **Intelligent Contact Discovery:** Includes confidence scoring and email validation through multiple providers.
- **Template-based Email Campaigns:** Supports personalization and multi-provider email integration.
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication secures user login, complemented by session-based authentication via Passport.js.
- **UI/UX:** A consistent design language, utilizing Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, ensures a professional and unified aesthetic. Emphasis is placed on clear navigation, responsive design, and intuitive user flows. Color schemes prioritize blues, grays, and greens.
- **Search Orchestration:** An enhanced search orchestrator includes retry logic, error handling, and real-time status tracking via webhooks.
- **Email Generation System:** Features a sophisticated system providing 42 unique email combinations derived from 7 distinct tones and 6 offer strategies (Hormozi, Formula, 1-on-1, Guarantee, Shiny, Study). Email content generation is modularized for maintainability.
- **Email Content Handling:** Preserves paragraph spacing from AI responses in generated emails.
- **Product Offers Generation:** Complete 6-strategy offer generation system with proper routing fix (Aug 2025) that bypasses boundary API for "Generate product offers" input. Includes clean UX flow that hides generation button after successful completion.
- **Product Offers Display:** Product offers now display in the Implementation tab of strategy detail pages, positioned below Daily Search Queries with matching design patterns and copy functionality (Aug 2025).
- **Search State Persistence:** Enhanced search input field synchronization to properly maintain query consistency between typed input and executed searches across page refreshes, ensuring displayed results always match the shown query (Sep 2025).
- **Lists Management Module:** Extracted lists functionality into self-contained module (Sep 2025), reducing 198 lines from main routes.ts. Module handles list CRUD operations, company associations, and demo list visibility for unauthenticated users.
- **Email Templates Module:** Extracted email templates functionality into self-contained module (Sep 2025), reducing 122 lines from main routes.ts. Module handles template CRUD operations, default template inheritance (userId=1 templates visible to all users), and integrates with QuickTemplates component and Outreach page.
- **User Account Settings Module:** Extracted user account management functionality into self-contained module (Sep 2025), reducing ~200 lines from main routes.ts. Module handles user profile management, preferences, email preferences, notifications system, and Easter egg features.
- **Email Replies Module:** Extracted email reply tracking functionality into self-contained module (Sep 2025), reducing ~140 lines from main routes.ts. Module handles reply tracking, sentiment analysis, and follow-up management (currently inactive feature).
- **Campaigns Module:** Extracted campaign management functionality into self-contained module (Sep 2025), reducing ~100 lines from main routes.ts. Module handles campaign creation, scheduling, and execution (currently inactive feature).
- **Rate Limiting Implementation:** Session-based rate limiting for demo users (Sep 2025) limiting to 10 searches per hour per session. Prevents external API abuse while maintaining demo experience. Applied to both quick-search and full search endpoints, with friendly message encouraging signup when limit reached.

## AI Testing Configuration

### Automated Browser Testing
This application supports Replit AI agent browser testing through an authentication bypass mechanism.

**How It Works:**
- When `ENABLE_AI_TEST_MODE=true` is set, all authentication is bypassed
- The AI agent operates as demo user (ID: 1)
- All pages and API endpoints are accessible without login
- Database operations use the demo user account

**Current Status:** ✅ ENABLED
- Environment: Development
- Test User ID: 1
- Email: demo@5ducks.ai

**For AI Testing Agents:**
1. No authentication required - proceed directly to any page
2. All API calls automatically authenticated
3. Use the application as a logged-in user
4. Data operations safe (demo user sandbox)

**Security:**
- Only works in development environment
- Cannot be enabled in production
- Logs all test mode access for audit
- To disable: Set `ENABLE_AI_TEST_MODE=false` or remove it
