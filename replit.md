- June 15, 2025. Duck header scroll compression: Implemented smooth scroll-triggered compression effect for mobile duck emoji header. Added scroll listener that immediately triggers when user scrolls (window.scrollY > 0), reducing emoji font sizes (🐥: text-2xl→text-lg, 🥚: text-lg→text-sm), compressing padding (pt-2 pb-1→pt-1 pb-0.5), and shrinking close button (w-5 h-5→w-4 h-4, p-1→p-0.5). Header maintains fixed positioning to overlay main navigation. All transitions use 300ms duration for smooth animation
- June 15, 2025. Button row spacing improvement: Added mb-6 (24px bottom margin) to Quick Templates button row containing "Merge View", "Merge Field", and "Save as Template" buttons for better visual separation from template dropdown section

- June 15, 2025. Mini footer simplification: Removed copyright text, reduced font size from text-sm to text-xs, and cut height in half by changing padding from py-4 to py-2. Footer now shows only "Soli Deo Gloria" and "LinkedIn" link with minimal footprint
- June 15, 2025. Contact search chips default optimization: Changed default configuration to enable only Core Leadership by default, while Department Heads and Middle Management start disabled. This focuses searches on C-level executives and founders by default, allowing users to manually expand scope as needed. Applied to both initial state and localStorage fallback configuration
- June 15, 2025. Search settings icon repositioning: Moved search settings icon from main search bar to lower right corner with absolute positioning (bottom-8 right-4). Made icon less prominent with 40% opacity, gray coloring, and smaller size (h-4 w-4). Icon remains fully functional but now sits discretely out of the main interface flow
- June 15, 2025. Mobile contact chips spacing optimization: Eliminated vertical spacing between search bar and contact chips on mobile screens by changing container gap from gap-2 to gap-0 md:gap-2. Creates seamless connection on narrow screens while maintaining proper spacing on desktop
- June 15, 2025. Mobile search input optimization: Repositioned search type selector from inside input field to below search button on mobile screens. Changed input padding from pr-20 to md:pr-20 pr-4 for maximum mobile typing space. Created responsive layout where contact chips and search selector share same row on mobile (justify-between) while maintaining separate rows on desktop. Preserves all functionality while maximizing mobile usability
- June 15, 2025. Mobile search type selector alignment fix: Changed mobile container alignment from items-center to items-start to prevent search type selector from jumping down when contact chips expand to multiple rows. Selector now stays anchored to top position for consistent user experience

- June 15, 2025. Connected mobile search interface: Removed gap between search input and button on mobile (md:gap-2 gap-0), implemented seamless connection with custom border radius (input: rounded-l-md rounded-r-none, button: rounded-l-none rounded-r-md). Creates unified search element on mobile while preserving separate elements on desktop for maximum input width
- June 15, 2025. Mobile padding optimization: Reduced horizontal padding across mobile interface - main container (px-2 md:px-6), search section (px-3 md:px-6), grid gaps (gap-3 md:gap-6), and section spacing (space-y-2 md:space-y-4). Creates tighter, more space-efficient mobile layout while maintaining desktop comfort
- June 15, 2025. Search placeholder text update: Changed search input placeholder from example-based text to encouraging message "Be as detailed as possible 🎯 😉" to prompt users for more detailed queries and better search results
- June 15, 2025. Mobile focus enhancement: Implemented mobile-only input focus animation with 3% width expansion (scaleX(1.03)) and internal blue border highlight. Uses CSS transitions for smooth animation and gently pushes search button right when input is active, solving the disjointed outline issue from connected interface
- June 15, 2025. Mobile focus enhancement fixes: Replaced scaleX transform with flex-grow expansion (1 to 1.03) to properly push search button right instead of overlapping. Added comprehensive focus-visible overrides with !important declarations to eliminate shadcn's default dark border/ring styling on mobile, ensuring only internal blue border appears
- June 15, 2025. Mobile focus styling refinement: Removed problematic width expansion approaches and simplified to clean internal border only. Changed border from thick blue (2px, rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4)) to thin light gray (1px, rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.3)) for subtle, professional focus indication on mobile devices
- June 15, 2025. Search placeholder text refinement: Removed winking emoji from placeholder text, changing from "Be as detailed as possible 🎯 😉" to "Be as detailed as possible 🎯" for cleaner, more professional appearance
- June 15, 2025. Search placeholder example update: Changed placeholder from motivational text to concrete example "Series-A Fintech companies in NYC " to demonstrate the specificity level and search format that works best with the B2B prospecting system
- June 15, 2025. Mobile button label optimization: Hidden text labels on mobile for "Start Selling", "5 More", and "Expand" buttons using `hidden md:inline` classes while preserving icons and desktop functionality. "Find Key Emails" button retains full text on all screen sizes for clarity
- June 15, 2025. Clean search interface optimization: Hide entire header container (emoji animation + "Search for target businesses" heading) when search results are present using conditional rendering (!currentResults). Saves ~60-80px vertical space and creates cleaner, more focused results interface while preserving welcoming introduction for new users
- June 15, 2025. Saved searches drawer button repositioning: Moved button from top-20 to top-32 on mobile (md:top-20 preserves desktop position) to prevent overlap with search input. Made button more compact on mobile (h-8 w-8 vs h-10 w-10 desktop) and scaled down ListChecks icon (h-4 w-4 vs h-5 w-5 desktop) for better mobile space efficiency
- June 15, 2025. Replies menu item hidden: Commented out "Replies" navigation item in main-nav.tsx navigation array to hide the unfinished feature while preserving code for future re-enablement
- June 15, 2025. Hamburger menu button border removal: Changed main navigation dropdown menu button from variant="outline" to variant="ghost" to remove border while preserving hover effects and background states

- June 15, 2025. First-time visitor authentication block removal: Eliminated immediate authentication modal for new users that was blocking the "try before you buy" experience. Removed shouldShowForFirstTimeUsers logic, hasVisitedBefore localStorage tracking, and cleaned up obsolete references. New users now get proper 14-second grace period to explore search functionality before authentication prompt
- June 15, 2025. Authentication delay extension: Increased semi-protected route authentication delay from 5 seconds to 14 seconds to give new users more time to explore and engage with search functionality before being prompted to register
- June 15, 2025. Company table URL click prevention: Modified company website URLs to be non-clickable text while keeping only the ExternalLink icon clickable. This prevents accidental URL clicks when users intend to expand company rows. Applied to both desktop and mobile views for consistent behavior
- June 15, 2025. Edge-to-edge mobile Companies Analysis layout: Changed root container padding from px-2 to px-0 on mobile devices (preserving md:px-6 for desktop) to eliminate the 8px left/right margins, allowing the Companies Analysis section to touch screen edges for maximum mobile space utilization
- June 15, 2025. Unified email deduplication system implementation: Created centralized email-utils.ts with mergeEmailData(), hasCompletedEmailSearch(), and normalizeEmail() functions. Replaced 6+ scattered email handling implementations across server/routes.ts with single source of truth, reducing code by ~65 lines. Added completion checks to Hunter.io, Apollo.io, AeroLeads, and Perplexity endpoints to prevent obsessive re-searching of contacts that already have emails. Fixed duplicate email bug where same email appeared in both primary and alternativeEmails fields due to race conditions between multiple search APIs
- June 15, 2025. Complete duplicate email fix implementation: Identified root cause as 160 contacts with same email in both primary and alternative fields from initial contact creation phase. Fixed with two-part solution: (1) Database cleanup removing duplicates from existing records using SQL array_remove function, (2) Prevention system with cleanContactData() function in email-utils.ts and integration into contact creation process in storage layer. Verified fix with zero remaining duplicates in database
- June 15, 2025. Comprehensive duplicate email fix finalization: Fixed additional 4 contacts with duplicates created after initial fix by identifying gap in mergeEmailData() function and missing deduplication in updateContact() method. Enhanced cleanContactData() with array checking, applied deduplication to contact updates in storage layer, and cleaned mergeEmailData() logic. Final verification shows zero duplicate emails in 2,875 total contacts. Prevention system now covers complete contact lifecycle (creation + updates + enrichment)
