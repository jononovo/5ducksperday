# User Instructions - Website URL Handling (May 18, 2025)

## Search Prompt Update
"We were getting some websites that were not official domains of the companies, so I edited the search prompt. There is no further action needed on this point from you. I'm just informing you."

## Website URL Display Request
"Can you add a very simple regex filter to the websites being received, to only show on the company page and list the domain itself, and not www. or https:// in front? But keep it as absolutely simple, and effective as possible. We want no duplication."

## Implementation Approach Guidance
"If we've already cleaned it when we received the information, that should be enough we don't need to clean it again before it gets shown on the company page right? Don't change anything just respond"

## Plan Revision Request
"Revise your plan and make it more efficient and present it to me"

## Solution Approval
"ok great. I like that."

## Documentation Request
"Can you summarize everything that was discussed in this chat? Then save it as a document in a folder called 'summaries' in the root. Save in this format: [date reverse[-chat- [description] Example: 250518-chat-Replies. And then make a second file of everything I've told you in this chat and save it in a similar format. Save in this format: [date reverse[-instructions- [description] Example: 250518-instructions-Replies"
